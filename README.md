# Microsoft 365 Integrations for Home Assistant

This repository provides overarching documentation for the various MS365 Integrations.

This project would not be possible without the wonderful [python-o365 project](https://github.com/O365/python-o365).

I work on these integrations because I like things to work well for myself and others. Please don't feel you are obligated to donate, but of course it is appreciated.
